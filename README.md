# Music Quiz Platform

## VÃ¤lipalautus 2

A very basic prototype of UI implemented. Most of the pages created and available for testing. Most of the forms created and available for testing. Note that any data (user accounts, quiz answers etc.) is not saved and any validation logic is not implemented, for example to check the quiz answers. None of the text content or layout design is final.

Navigation is available, but here's a list of pages:
* /
* /register
* /login
* /logout
* /admin
* /user
* /accountremoved
* /quiz
* /quizresult
* /newquiz

No need for creating any databases, installing flask should be enough to run the app locally and test the UI.
